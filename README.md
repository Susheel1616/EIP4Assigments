Definitions

1) Convolution: Filtering an image or combining image or a series with another.  If we take 3 *3 filter and slide over a complete image of 5 * 5 and take dot product of filter and chunk of input image then this process is called convultion i.e. filtering image based on the size of filter. It is a small filter applied to large input which result in a feature map.

2) Filters/Kernrels: Feature extractor is called Filter / kernel. It extracts features

3) Epoch: A Pass or iteration or going through the data set is called an Epoch. 1 pass is 1 epoch and "n" passes are N Epochs

4) 1 * 1 convolution: It is applies 1 * 1 filter as part of convolution. It maps input pixel to an output pixel

5) 3 * 3 convolution: It is applies 3 * 3 filter as part of convolution. 

6) Feature Map: It is map or collection of Features. For example collection of all the "e" alphabets is a feature map

7) Activation function: It defines output of node given an input or set of inputs

8) Receptive field: The field of the last layer (at the end) that has full view of image to make decision and correctly classify the image. It must at least be size of object you are lookin
